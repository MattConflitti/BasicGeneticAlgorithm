# BasicGeneticAlgorithm
A basic genetic algorithm that will be built upon for more meaningful tasks.

Starting with a population of 100 genomes, the population is given 100 generations to breed and mutate to find the maximum point of the landscape that is created with a multivariable variable function in 3D space. It is successful in finding the maximum point in about 10-15 generations.
